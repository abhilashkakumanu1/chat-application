This repo is to learn fundamentals of typescript &amp; socket.io

## TypeScript Notes

1. Its backward compatible with JS => meaning all JS code is valid TS code
2. Its just development time tool (compile time) - it doesn't do anything at **runtime**. JS is an interpreted language unlike Java. There is no compilation step involved. But with TS there is a compilation step
3. All static languages have compilation step => for type checking
4. Available types in TS are
   1. number
   2. string
   3. boolean
   4. any
   5. void
5. You can select the o/p spec of JS - like ES6, ES7, etc. Without TS you will need something like Babel to transpile newer JS to older one
