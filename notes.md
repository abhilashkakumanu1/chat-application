- [x] Send messages typed in FE to the server & broadcast them
- [x] Display messages typed by one user for everyone who connected
- [x] **Identify users** - username functionality - (imp)
- [x] Notify others when new user gets added
- [ ] show if someone is Typing...(interesting!) => emit an event whenever the active state of input box changes & toggle isActive inside the eventListener on server
- [ ] Show list of online users - UI to see list of active users
- [ ] Maintain a history of messages (Good to have) => DB? In-Memory array will do for now
- [ ] serve the website from localhost to the world (multi users can connect without putting it on server) - for testing multi-chat support locally => very very cool thing
- [ ] user login support to identify separate users - instead of taking each connection as a new user (ask him username) + chat anonymous => give cool random usernames like pink-unicorn etc (like how Google Docs does it)

### Good to have

- [ ] Instead of user connected - say "abhi" connected => take username before page loads and pass it to io()

## Ideas

1. From next app onwards
   1. create a plan - entity relationship diagram, class diagram, use cases diagrams
   2. divide work
   3. work parallel & review each other's code
